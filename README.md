# PLL Take Home Backend

## Project Description

You are given the task to create a system architecture for a service to autogenerate a fantasy lacrosse team. You will be given sample JSON data that will contain information relevant for making decision on what players would make the best team.

### Project Setup
Install all the packages
Run `npm install`

To run the project run `npm run dev`

### Tasks

- [ ] Commit early and often. It is important to see your thought process. Act like you are collaborating with other engineers on the project.

- [ ] Implement folder structure to keep the files clean and easy to understand the purpose

- [ ] Create a system architecture design utilizing any AWS services for storing and fetching the data (No restrictions on a relational vs NoSql database, explain your reasoning for why you chose the services)

- [ ] Mock fetching the data from a database by using the sample fantasyPlayerInfo.json file

- [ ] Use the given information about the players to create a function that would auto generate the "best" team, not all fields are required. Explain your thought process on the "best" team

- [ ] Create REST API routes to save the generated team, get your saved team, and delete the team. Implement best practices for REST APIs

- [ ] Write a single unit test to test the team auto generating functions
